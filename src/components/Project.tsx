                <p>(On going) Developed a classifier in PyTorch using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to map drug samples into a latent space, identifying cocaineâ€™s origin based on chemical composition. Benchmarked the model as part of a research collaboration with NIRLAB and EPFL</p>

                <p>This study explored the feasibility of integrating portable spectroscopic techniques,
such as Near Infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy, into cocaine seizure profiling.
By evaluating clustering methods combined with dimensionality reduction, this method
uncover chemical links among samples and determine common sources. The
findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy, when coupled with dimensionality reduction
techniques like t-SNE, significantly improves clustering performance by organizing spectral
data into separable patterns. K-means clustering exhibited strong performance, while
DBSCAN and HDBSCAN faced limitations due to varying cluster densities.</p>
