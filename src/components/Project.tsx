                <p>(On going) Developed a classifier using Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to map drug samples into a latent space, identifying cocaineâ€™s origin based on chemical composition. Benchmarked the model as part of a research collaboration with NIRLAB and EPFL</p>

                <p>My research project explored the feasibility of integrating portable spectroscopic techniques,
                such as Near Infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy, into cocaine seizure profiling.
                By evaluating clustering methods combined with dimensionality reduction, this method
                uncover chemical links among samples and determine common sources. The
                findings demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy, when coupled with dimensionality reduction
                techniques like t-SNE, significantly improves clustering performance by organizing spectral
                data into separable patterns. K-means clustering exhibited strong performance, while
                DBSCAN and HDBSCAN faced limitations due to varying cluster densities.</p>

                <p>Developed a Java-based application that decodes ADS-B messages from aircraft using the AirSpy R2 software-defined radio, capturing signals on the 1090 MHz frequency to extract real-time flight data such as identity, speed, and position, and visualizing this information on an interactive map for live air traffic monitoring.</p>

                <p>With friends we noticed that students struggle to find quick help when they need it, which can be really stressful and frustrating. To solve this, we created a campus-specific tutoring app that instantly connects students with available tutors. Our app is built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, JavaScript, Cloud Functions, and Firebase. I am happy to make a live demo when we meet as it is only available for the students from the campus.</p>
